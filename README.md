# Creating an API with GraphQL and Hot Chocolate

This is my first time working with GraphQL and Hot Chocolate building an API. To do this, I´m working with .NET 7 version. 

### Why GraphQL?
It is a powerful query language that allows the client to search all the data by using just one endpoint. It´s important to highlight that this is not a data base, it´s help to set data. Check the documentation bellow:

### What is Hot Chocolate?
It´s an open-source server for GraphQL.
